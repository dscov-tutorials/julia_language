site_description: "The Julia language aims to give its users the rare combination of exceptional performance and expressiveness. Its syntax is similar to MATLAB or Python, but its performance is on the order of C, Fortran, or C++. This tutorial provides an introduction to Julia, explores its many features, and demonstrates its advantages for data science and technical computing more broadly. No prior experience with Julia is required."
